            <li>
                Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, white sugar, 
                and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.

                <br>

            <li>
                Mix Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually
