            of <strong>herbaceous</strong> and <em>flavorful</em> tastes creates a rich and enjoyable culinary experience.

            <li>
                Cook the Spaghetti: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions 
                until al dente. Reserve some pasta water before draining the 
                spaghetti.
            </li>

                <br>

            <li>
                Prepare the Pesto Sauce: In a food processor, combine fresh 
                basil leaves, a peeled garlic clove, pine nuts, grated Pecorino 
                cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese. Pulse until the ingredients 
                are finely chopped.
            </li>

                <br>
                
            <li>
                Add Olive Oil: While the food processor is running, slowly add 
                olive oil to the mixture until it reaches a smooth, creamy 
                consistency.
            </li>

                <br>

            <li>
                Season the Sauce: Season the pesto sauce with salt and pepper 
                to taste. You can add a little reserved pasta water if the sauce 
                is too thick.
            </li>

                <br>

            <li>
                Combine the Pasta and Sauce: In a large bowl, mix the cooked 
                spaghetti with the pesto sauce. Toss until the pasta is evenly 
                coated.
            </li>

                <br>

            <li>
                Serve: Serve the pasta in bowls, and garnish with extra Parmesan 
                shavings and a drizzle of olive oil for an extra touch of flavor.
